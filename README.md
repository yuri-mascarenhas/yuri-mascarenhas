## About Me 👋

Hi, my name is Yuri and I'm a graduate student at Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) and intern at BTG Pactual, currently focusing on full-stack web development and Information Security. 
I have also a great interest in creative coding, using the p5.js library.

Besides that I really love reading and music, being a self taught multi-instrumentalist, and I have two released albuns in spotify with my former band.

So, I'm someone always looking for improving myself and trying to align my passion for technology and arts, especialy music.
